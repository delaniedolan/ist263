        <h2>Personal info</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, my name is Delanie Dolan. I am majoring in finance and business analytics. I also have declared information management and technology as a minor. I've always been interested in business, however I decided upon my majors and minor after learning more about Excel my freshman year of college. Upon graduation, I am going to work in New York City as a <strong>business consultant</strong>. I became attracted to this career because of the variety of different people and concepts I'd be working with. My hometown is Fort Salonga, New York on Long Island. Fort Salonga is home to a few small beaches and is quite warm during the summer, so going to the beach is one of my favorite past times. I have 2 younger sisters who I enjoy spending time with as well in my free time.
